**1. What Is the Default Value of an Array for Different Data Types?**

   The default values of elements in an array depend on the data type:
   - Numeric data types (int, float, double, etc.) default to 0.
   - `boolean` defaults to `false`.
   - Reference data types (e.g., objects) default to `null`.

**2. Can You Pass a Negative Number as the Array Size?**

   No, you cannot pass a negative number as the size of an array in Java. Attempting to create an array with a negative size will result in a runtime exception, specifically `NegativeArraySizeException`.

**3. Where Does an Array Store in JVM Memory?**

   Arrays are stored in the heap memory area of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Each element of the array is allocated memory in a contiguous block of memory.

**4. What Are the Disadvantages of Arrays?**

   Some disadvantages of arrays in Java include:
   - Fixed size: Arrays have a fixed size, making it challenging to dynamically adjust their size.
   - Lack of built-in methods: Arrays do not provide built-in methods for common operations like adding or removing elements.
   - Inefficient for search and insertion: Searching and inserting elements in an array can be inefficient for large arrays.
   - Homogeneous data: Arrays can only store elements of the same data type.

**5. What Is an Anonymous Array in Java? Give an Example.**

   An anonymous array in Java is an array that is declared and initialized without specifying its name. It is typically used for short-lived arrays that don't need a variable name. Here's an example:

   ```java
   int[] numbers = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Anonymous array
   ```

**6. What Are the Different Ways to Traverse an Array in Java?**

   There are several ways to traverse (iterate through) an array in Java:
   - Using a `for` loop with an index.
   - Using a `for-each` loop (enhanced `for` loop).
   - Using a `while` loop with an index.
   - Using a `do-while` loop with an index.

   Here's an example using a `for-each` loop:

   ```java
   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   for (int num : numbers) {
       System.out.println(num);
   }
   ```

**7. What Is the Difference Between `length` and `length()` Methods? Give Examples.**

   - `length` is a property of arrays in Java and is used to get the number of elements in the array.
   - `length()` is a method of the `String` class in Java and is used to get the number of characters in a string.

   Example with `length` for an array:

   ```java
   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   int arrayLength = numbers.length; // Gets the number of elements in the array
   ```

   Example with `length()` for a string:

   ```java
   String text = "Hello, World!";
   int stringLength = text.length(); // Gets the number of characters in the string
   ```
