- Each assignment has its own folder (e.g., `ArraysInJava`, `ArraysInJavaPart2`, etc.).
- Within each assignment folder, you will find the Java source code file (e.g., `ArraysInJava.java`) and a `README.md` file that provides specific instructions or information about the assignment.
- The root of the repository contains this `README.md` file, which serves as the main documentation for the repository.
