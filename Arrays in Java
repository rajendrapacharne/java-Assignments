**1. What Do You Mean by an Array?**

   An array is a data structure in Java (and many other programming languages) that allows you to store a collection of elements of the same data type in a single variable. Arrays are used to hold multiple values under one name, making it easier to manage and manipulate large sets of data.

**2. How to Create an Array?**

   To create an array in Java, you can use the following syntax:
   
   ```java
   dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[arrayLength];
   ```

   For example:
   
   ```java
   int[] numbers = new int[5];
   ```

**3. Can We Change the Size of an Array at Runtime?**

   No, in Java, the size of an array is fixed upon creation and cannot be changed at runtime. If you need a dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink, consider using a `List` (e.g., `ArrayList`) instead.

**4. Can You Declare an Array Without Assigning the Size of an Array?**

   Yes, you can declare an array without specifying its size. For example:
   
   ```java
   int[] numbers;
   ```

   However, you'll need to initialize it with a specific size before you can use it, like this:
   
   ```java
   numbers = new int[5];
   ```

**5. What Is the Default Value of an Array?**

   The default values of elements in an array depend on the data type:
   
   - Numeric data types (int, float, double, etc.) default to 0.
   - `boolean` defaults to `false`.
   - Reference data types (e.g., objects) default to `null`.
   
**6. What Is an ID Array with an Example?**

   An "ID array" typically refers to an array that holds identifiers or unique values, often used in situations where each element corresponds to an entity or object with a unique ID. For example, an array of student IDs:
   
   ```java
   int[] studentIDs = {101, 102, 103, 104, 105};
   ```

**7. Write a Program on a 2D Array?**

   Sure, here's a simple Java program that demonstrates the creation and traversal of a 2D array:

   ```java
   public class TwoDArrayExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           int[][] matrix = {
               {1, 2, 3},
               {4, 5, 6},
               {7, 8, 9}
           };

           System.out.println("2D Array Elements:");

           for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
               for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
                   System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
               }
               System.out.println(); // Move to the next row
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   This program creates a 2D array `matrix` and prints its elements in a row-by-row format.
